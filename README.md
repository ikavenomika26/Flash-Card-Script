# Flash-Card-Script
After three months of learning python, this is my first project I undertook myself without coding along in some tutorial.
the main keywords this script uses are as follows:
- yes
- no
- quit
the script is case sensitive for anything that is not a command so selecting 'python' instead of 'Python' will return an invalid input
the edit set function is fucking horrendous, but functional nonetheless
"Why does this code suck?" well I'm a damn beginner and was feeling dissatisfied so I wanted to just create SOMETHING. I guess anything is better than nothing :P
Thanks for checking this out <3
